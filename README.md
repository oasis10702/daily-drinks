Daily Drinks is an app for filling out a handmade drink form

![](demo.gif)

**Feature**

- `add` and `delete` drink order
- `edit` drink order

**Description**

the app is mainly built by react (v16 hooks), react-redux, and pure CSS. Just like a simple todo-list.

**Testing**

By far, only unit tests for utils.

**Todo**

- Implement more error handling, i.e. handle price is required a number, not other types, handle empty input is invaild.

- UI beautify, I would use material-UI and JSS to make the app more beautifully. And add some advanced CSS animation.

- Implement E2E testing.
